# "SpaceWars"

## Why?
I developed this simple game project as a way to learn ASP.Net SignalR. While the game could have been built using something other than a WPF desktop application, I decided to take on the challenge to see if I could make it work. The project is still a work in progress, and in the future, I plan to rebuild the game from scratch using C++ and the Raylib library.
